# Noise 
# - noise_hz [Hz]: per bar noise rate is 10 times cosmic muon rate, 337.5 Hz (10* 1/60hz * 450cm*4.5cm)
# - noise_window [ns], noise will be sampled uniformly within [-noise_window, noise_window]

# Cosmic
# - cosmic_rate: number of cosmic events per digitized event. This includes muon, electron, gamma, neutron and proton
#    This is calculated by a pre-selected window of +/- 1000 ns. 3.66 cosmic events / mathusla40.
